# `r fa(name = "hand-holding-heart")` Psychology: Emotions during the pandemic

>In studies of emotions, a robust finding is that there is a relationship between aging and improved emotional experience. It's a well-recognized fact that older people often report higher levels of emotional wellbeing compared to younger people.


***During the pandemic, did older people still feel better emotionally than younger ones?***

---

## Emotions ...

945 participants with 107 variables!

- Primary variables: 16 positive and 13 negative emotions 
  - frequency and intensity of positive emotions
  - frequency and intensity of negative emotions
  - average frequency and intensity of positive and negative emotions
  - age
- Other variables (personality traits):
  - Openness,
  - Conscientiousness
  - Extraversion
  - Agreeableness and
  - Emotional Stability

# `r fa(name = "lightbulb")` Business insights: Small automotive business

> By using data analytics, small businesses can gain insights into their customers, their products, and their operations. This information can help them make better decisions about how to run their business.

***Which customers contribute more income around the year?***


---

## Small business ...

This is a dataset of the jobs performed by a small automotive business located in Botany in 2010-2020. The dataset is itemised by each job performed and further by invoice number such that several jobs (and several cars) can be on a single invoice. The dataset also contains basic information about each car (make, model, date of last service, odometer reading), information about the date and cost of the job, and the postcode of the customer.

- Variables of interest:
  - Date of the job
  - Cost of the job

- Other variables:
  - Postcode of costumer
  - Car make and model
  - Date of last service
  - Odometer reading

---

## Small business ... 

#### Data

The data will be provided by uDASH staff.


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

  group_by(INVOICE_NO,Postcode,transaction_date,service_date) |>
  summarise(total_cost=sum(TOTAL),vehicle_year=max(VEHICLE_YEAR))
```

#### Cleaning and transformation

The dataset was entered by hand and thus has inconsistencies and omissions that will require cleaning.  Some data cleaning has already been performed. 


#### Explore

Histograms to show the spread and frequency of vehicle repair costs. Transform data to improve Visualisation.

####  Model

# `r fa(name = "cloud-sun-rain")` Climate: Weather & Air Quality in Schools

> Good air quality in Sydney was something that many of us took for granted until the Black Summer Bushfires in 2019-2020. From serious health effects to general inconvenience, it was suddenly hard to ignore just how important the air we breathe truly is. However, fires aren’t the only phenomenon that can impact our air quality: urbanisation, pollution, and weather events can all influence our health and wellbeing.

***Can we predict air quality in Sydney using information about the weather?***

---

## Weather & Air Quality ...

This dataset contains 115 different variables documenting local weather and air quality measured at 12 different sites around Sydney.

- Weather-related variables:
  - temperature `t`, relative humidity `rh`,
  - air pressure `p`, rainfall `rain`,
  - wind direction `wd`, and wind speed `ws`

- Air-quality related variables:
  - concentrations of nitrogen dioxide `no2`, sulphur dioxide `so2`,
  - carbon monoxide `co`, ozone `o3`,
  - particulate matter <2.5μm `pm25`, and <10μm `pm10`.

Since measurements are taken every 20 minutes, we have 43771 data points!

---

## Weather & Air Quality ... 

#### Data

Detailed time-series weather and air-quality data collected at Sydney schools are available for download via [TERN](https://www.tern.org.au/news-swaq-data/), but a cleaned version will be provided by uDASH staff.


```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# reading in data
airqual <- read_csv("data/air-quality.csv") |>
  # nice names
  clean_names() |>
  # Sydney (AEST) is UTC +10
  mutate(time_local = time + hours(10))

```

#### Cleaning and transformation

- Time Twist: convert time format from UTC to Sydney local time.
- Data Detangle: instead of cluttered 116 columns- one new column for location and 12 other columns, each for a different climate  variable!

```{r message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# changing column structure of data
airqual_wide <- airqual |>
  # now that we have local time don't need utc
  select(-time) |>
  pivot_longer(-time_local) |>
  mutate(var_type = as.factor(str_sub(name, start = 6)),
         location = as.factor(str_sub(name, end = 4))) |>
  select(-name) |>
  # wider back to the format we want
  pivot_wider(names_from = var_type, values_from = value)
```

#### Explore

Relationships between key variables for each site.

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
school_with_airqual_measurements <- airqual_wide %>%
  group_by(location) %>%
  select(pm10) %>% # using pm10 to check if have any air quality measurements
  summarise(num_measurements = sum(!is.na(pm10))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # select only school with non-zero amount of measurements
  filter(num_measurements > 0) %>%
  # get list of schools
  pull(location)

# only want data from schools in the list we created
airqual_clean <- airqual_wide %>%
  filter(location %in% school_with_airqual_measurements)

# restricting to get UNSW data
unsw_data <- airqual_clean %>%
  # only unsw
  filter(location == "unsw") %>%
  # Jan 2021
  filter(time_local > "2021-01-01" & time_local < "2021-02-01") %>%
  # need no2 measurements
  drop_na(no2) %>%
  # only weather variables, time, and no2
  select(time_local, no2, t, rh, p, rain, wd, ws) %>%
  # get hour of the day
  mutate(hour = hour(time_local)) %>%
  # get day of the week
  mutate(dow = as.factor(wday(time_local)))
```

#### Model

Multiple linear regression, for example between temperature, relative humidity, and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.

> Environmental factors such as water temperature, conductivity, and time of day significantly influence the behavioral patterns of Giant Mud Crabs, including their movement, activity levels, and periods of heightened activity

*** Are there significant correlations or patterns that can be explored to understand response to climate variability? *** 

---

## Mud Crab Tracking  ...

Crabs were tracked using acoustic telemetry, which involved attaching tags with distinct sounds.To pick up these sounds, receiver stations, functioning like listening posts, were set up in the study area. When a crab was within range of three or more receivers, its exact location could be determined. Acceleration was measured along three axes for a period of 20 seconds, recording 5 measurements per second (5 Hz).
    <div style="float:right;">
    <img src="images/crab_speed_measure.jpeg" alt="Crab Speed Measure"/>
  </div>
- Primary variables:
  - crab: Unique identifier for each crab
  - sex: male/female
  - cl_mm: Size of the crab's shell in millimeters
  - time: Timestamp  YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
  - lat, lon: Geospatial measurements in degrees
  - x, y: The easting and northing of the detection in meters 
  - accel: The acceleration of the crab in meters per second squared 
  - temperature_c: Water temperature in degrees Celsius 
  - conductivity_ms_cm: Electrical conductivity in millisiemens per centimeter
